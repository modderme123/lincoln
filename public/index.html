            Abraham Lincoln was thoughtful, strong, kind, independent, and famously tall. These movie-star-like characteristics are what captured the
            interest of filmmakers, novelists, and marketers, some of whose creations are shown in Section 3. Lincoln was a self-made man, whose
            nickname “Honest Abe,” a nickname inspired by his behavior which only persisted as he grew older.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seems clear, drawing from historical records and documentation, that Abraham Lincoln believed honesty and integrity to be core to a
            man's values, and although law, one of Lincoln’s earlier professions, was seen as largely dishonest, Lincoln was quoted saying, “Resolve
            to be honest at all events; and if, in your own judgment, you can not be an honest lawyer, resolve to be honest without being a lawyer.
            Choose some other occupation.” This highlights his core values which later served him well as a president and in legacy, which we’ll be
            focusing on here.

      <h1 data-move="0.025">Abraham Lincoln in Advertising</h1>
      <p data-move="0.015">
        One of the largest usages of Lincoln is in advertising, as would be expectedーa popular, wise, and trusted authority figure is one of the best
        ways to market a product. Here are some notable examples:
      </p>
      <div class="split">
        <iframe data-move="0.035" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wdpOIaGnzvA"></iframe>
        <p data-move="0.015">
          In a commercial for a sleep aid, Rozerem, Lincoln appears as a wise and knowledgeable figure at the table, sitting with the person suffering
          from insomnia and a talking beaver. He appears kind and understanding, while still engaging in conversation as if an equal. This is a
          clear-cut reason why Lincoln is so commonly used in advertisingーpeople believe in what he says, and empathize with him.
        </p>

      <div class="split">
        <p data-move="0.015" style="width: 65%; flex: 65">
          Lincoln Logs are now marketed as representative of Abraham Lincoln, although the original history is not clear. Lincoln Logs were the
          property of Knex, who named them after Lincoln, “who began his celebrated life in a log cabin in Kentucky.” The logs were a success because
          they were a lot more stable (in terms of construction), and had an appealing title.
        </p>

      <p data-move="0.015">
        The “Honest Abe” deals used for marketing use Lincoln as synonymous with product integrity. This not only shows how Lincoln has impacted pop
        culture, but also how pop culture has impacted himーthat a deal would be named after him reinforces the idea of his being honest and
        accountable.

      <p data-move="0.01">
        Lincoln has been listed in an immense number of movies, TV shows, novels, and advertisements during and since his death, with an impressive
        15,000 books written about him, a number second to only Jesus, according to historian Paul Tetreault. There is a common thread among these
        portrayals, though: depictions of a hero, one who is both universally revered and relatable. Many advertisements also make use of his famous
        moniker, “Honest Abe,” to put integrity behind their products. Here, we’ve compiled some portrayals of Lincoln to illustrate these points.

            While this newspaper obituary seems very unrelated to presidential legacy, the far-reaching influence of a presidential nickname is shown
            here. For almost every other president, their name would be used rather plainly, but Lincoln is described with a word with such a positive
            connotation, part of a widely accepted nickname.

            This triumphant song lists Lincoln’s virtuesー”honest, frank, and true.” Although the presence of this song may be an older custom,
            presidential election songs, perhaps, I can’t recall the last time I heard of a song like this for a president. (Imagine an official Trump
            campaign song.)
          </p>
          <p>
            While seemingly exaggeratory, I think this song, like the previous source, highlights the omnipotence and appeal of Lincoln very well.
          </p>

            This song, unlike the previous, seems to focus on Lincoln’s origin and toil, almost to empathize with the listeners. In this way, he is
            both revered and relatable. Lincoln is put in the same boat as liberty, almost a campaign tactic. However, the near-biblical imagery of
            his fight against the “Slavocrat’s giant” seems to back the claims about Lincoln. It further emphasizes the good in Lincoln, and is almost
            a rallying cry.

          Lincoln (portrayals of Lincoln) appeared in 297 different films and TV shows from 1911 to 2012, more than Batman, Sherlock Holmes, and James
          Bond! This is another testament to his appeal, as well as the broad range of interpretation of this president. He appears as both a cool
          authority figure (<a href="https://youtu.be/S67sDHdhpio">Bill & Ted</a>) as well as a vampire hunter (Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter), or
          famed statesman (Lincoln). Much as with the songs, Lincoln’s level of cinematic portrayal is unique: when was the last time you saw a zombie
          apocalypse movie starring, say, JFK?
        </p>
        <p>
          It is thought that Lincoln’s real voice was in fact much higher than his generally low and booming movie portrayal. This is perhaps yet
          another symbol of how mainstream Lincoln has become, and how pop culture has impacted our perception of him.

        What we've found through looking at Lincoln's portrayal through history is that Lincoln's early actions and morals shaped his life, and his
        great deeds have become greater through advertising and pop culture.
