            Abraham Lincoln was thoughtful, strong, kind, independent, and famously tall. These movie-star-like characteristics are what captured the
            interest of filmmakers, novelists, and marketers, some of whose creations are shown in Section 3. Lincoln was a self-made man. He forged a
            path independent of his fathers, at a time when that was very uncommon, leading him to become a politician instead of the farmer that his
            father was.
          </p>
          <p>
            His nickname “Honest Abe” was given to him while working as a store clerk in New Salem, IIIーaccording to one popular story, after the
            store closed for the night, Lincoln walked three miles to give a customer a few pennies after he accidentally shortchanged him. This
            nickname only persisted as he entered law, as his colleagues ranked him top of his profession in the state because of their confidence
            that he never told a lie.

        Most beliefs about Lincoln have only grown through time, and “Honest Abe” is no exception. However, from accounts of his friends and family,
        it seems clear that Abraham Lincoln believed that honesty and integrity were core to a man's values, and although law was seen as largely
        dishonest, Lincoln was quoted saying, “Resolve to be honest at all events; and if, in your own judgment, you can not be an honest lawyer,
        resolve to be honest without being a lawyer. Choose some other occupation.”

      <p data-move="0.01">
        Lincoln has been listed in an immense number of movies, TV shows, novels, and advertisements during and since his deathーLincoln, as of 2012,
        had appeared in 297 different films and TV shows since 1911, with an even more impressive 15,000 books written about him, a number second to
        only Jesus, according to historian Paul Tetreault. There is a common thread among these portrayals, though: depictions of a hero, one who is
        both universally revered and relatable. Many advertisements also make use of his famous moniker, “Honest Abe,” to put integrity behind their
        products. Here, we’ve compiled some portrayals of Lincoln to illustrate these points.

            While this newspaper obituary seems very unrelated to presidential legacy, the far-reaching influence of a presidential nickname is shown
            here. For almost every other president, their name would be used rather plainly, but Lincoln is described with a word with such a positive
            connotation, part of a widely accepted nickname. If you compare this nickname to that of other presidents, he holds some of the most
            positive ones. This source displays the influence and spread of this favorable nickname.

            This triumphant song lists Lincoln’s virtuesー”honest, frank, and true.” Although the presence of this song may be an older custom,
            presidential election songs, perhaps, I can’t recall the last time I heard of a song like this for a president. (Imagine an official Trump
            campaign song.)
          </p>
          <p>
            This song notes another of Lincoln’s exceptional qualities, that he is at once the “white man’s friend” and also “does not want slavery to
            extend.” This is not equivalent to, but is certainly reminiscent of the bipartisan appeal of Lincoln, who seems to capture very opposite
            audiences, especially in more modern times.
          </p>
          <p>
            While seemingly exaggeratory, I think this song, like the previous source, highlights the omnipotence and appeal of Lincoln very well.

          <p>
            This song, unlike the previous, seems to focus on Lincoln’s origin and toil, almost to empathize with the listeners. In this way, he is
            both revered and relatable. Lincoln is put in the same boat as liberty, almost a campaign tactic. However, the near-biblical imagery of
            his fight against the “Slavocrat’s giant” seems to back the claims about Lincoln. It further emphasizes the good in Lincoln, and is almost
            a rallying cry.

          Lincoln (portrayals of Lincoln) appeared in 297 different films and TV shows from 1911 to 2012, more than Batman, Sherlock Holmes, and James
          Bond! This is another testament to his appeal, as well as the broad range of interpretation of this president. He appears as both a cool
          authority figure (<a href="https://youtu.be/S67sDHdhpio">Bill & Ted</a>) as well as a vampire hunter (Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter), or
          famed statesman (Lincoln). Much as with the songs, Lincoln’s level of cinematic portrayal is unique: when was the last time you saw a zombie
          apocalypse movie starring, say, JFK?
        </p>
        <p>
          It is thought that Lincoln’s real voice was in fact much higher than his generally low and booming movie portrayal. This is perhaps yet
          another symbol of how mainstream Lincoln has become, and how pop culture has impacted our perception of him.

      <h1>Abraham Lincoln in Advertising</h1>
      <p>
        Lincoln Logs are now marketed as representative of Abraham Lincoln, although the original history is not clear. Lincoln Logs were the property
        of Knex, who described them as stemming from Lincoln’s log cabin: “The product is named after Abraham Lincoln, the President who began his
        celebrated life in a log cabin in Kentucky”. The logs were originally inspired by a house in Japan. The blocks were a success because they
        were a lot more stable, and had a much more appealing title than one of their competitors: Froebel blocks.
